# Assessment Overview

## Add Your Name Here

Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these
questions as a part of your **technical development** grade in this course.
It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all
of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory grade for one or more parts
of the assessment of your work in the technical development category.

Finally, please note that you cannot "spend a token" in order to receive the
opportunity to revise and request a reassessment of the work in this repository.

### Technical Development Reflection

TODO: Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about each skill in
the area of technical development for software engineering. Each sentence
that you write should be accompanied by at least one reference that supports
your summarization. While you are encouraged to cite content from the "Software
Engineering at Google" book, it is acceptable for you to cite any source
available online. Please make sure that every reference that you provide is to a
web site link that the instructor can reference. Ultimately, you can think of
the sentence that you write as advice that you would give to a student at the
start of the next edition of the Software Engineering course.

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the prompts in the following sections.

#### Explain at least one insight from the "Fuzzing Book" that you have applied to your practice of software engineering

TODO: Write a one paragraph response to this question.

#### Explain at least one insight from the "Debugging Book" that you have applied to your practice of software engineering

TODO: Write a one paragraph response to this question.

#### What is one practice from the Fuzzing/Debugging book that enabled you to become a more joy-filled software engineer?

TODO: Write a one paragraph response to this question.

#### From the perspective of technical development and the content in the Fuzzing/Debugging book, what is the greatest weakness of your software engineering team? Why? How would you advise the team to improve?

TODO: Write a one paragraph response to this question.

#### From the perspective of technical development and the content in the Fuzzing/Debugging book, what is your greatest weakness? Why? How do you plan to improve after the completion of this course?

TODO: Write a one paragraph response to this question.

### Lessons Learned in Technical Development

TODO: Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about each skill in
the area of technical development for software engineering. Each sentence that
you write should be accompanied by at least one reference that supports your
summarization. While you are encouraged to cite content from Fuzzing/Debugging
book, it is acceptable for you to cite any source available online. Please make
sure that every reference that you provide is to a web site link that the
instructor can reference. Ultimately, you can think of the sentence that you
write as advice that you would give to a student at the start of the next
edition of the Software Engineering course.

technical development, then explain why you did not do so, providing all
relevant details.

### GitHub Commits

#### Commits During the Final Module

TODO: How many commits did you make to the Developer Development web site during the
last module of the academic semester? Please note that commits only count if
they appear in the listing of commits for the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/TeamDevDev/www.developerdevelopment.com. Please also note
that you should only count commits that were completed during the weeks that
pertain to this technical development assessment.

TODO: For work connected to the theme of technical development, I made `X`
commits to the Developer Development web site during this module.

#### Commits Across the Entire Semester

TODO: How many commits did you make to the Developer Development web site
during the entire academic semester? Please note that commits only count if
they appear in the final listing of commits for the following GitHub
repository: https://github.com/TeamDevDev/www.developerdevelopment.com. Please
note that you should report a count of all of the commits that you completed
